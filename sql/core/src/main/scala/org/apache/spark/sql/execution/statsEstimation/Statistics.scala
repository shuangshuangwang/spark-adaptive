/**
 * Estimates of various statistics.  The default estimation logic simply lazily multiplies the
 * corresponding statistic produced by the children.  To override this behavior, override
 * `statistics` and assign it an overridden version of `Statistics`.
 *
 * '''NOTE''': concrete and/or overridden versions of statistics fields should pay attention to the
 * performance of the implementations.  The reason is that estimations might get triggered in
 * performance-critical processes, such as query plan planning.
 *
 * Note that we are using a BigInt here since it is easy to overflow a 64-bit integer in
 * cardinality estimation (e.g. cartesian joins).
 *
 * @param sizeInBytes Physical size in bytes. For leaf operators this defaults to 1, otherwise it
 *                    defaults to the product of children's `sizeInBytes`.
 * @param rowCount Estimated number of rows.
